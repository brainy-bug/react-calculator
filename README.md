The goal of this project is to build a Calculator App similar to the design above.
Technologies & tools will be proposed down below but feel free to use different ones if you're more familiar with them. Have fun along the way. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‹

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Project Requirements

- AC stands for "All Clear", it should clear previous operations, incoming operations as well as the output value and bring back Calculator to the initial state.

- C stands for "Clear", it should only delete the last entry.

- Users should be able to input numbers and execute all the available operations (calculate percentage value, divide, multiply, subtract and add).

- Users should be able to get the correct result by pressing the "=" operator and add a decimal by pressing "." (maximum one decimal in the number should be present).

- Watch out for other `gotchas`, e.g. multiple operations (always execute "number operation number", don't evaluate more than a single pair of numbers), round long decimals, don't allow "=" on empty input, don't let to divide by 0. You'll probably find more `gotchas` while coding ðŸ™ˆðŸ˜Ž.

## Additional Requirements

- When something `"wrong"` happens, display a nice error message to the user. (e.g. when the user tries to divide by 0).

- Add hover effects, transitions. Experiment with it.

## Technologies & Tools

- CSS
- React
- MathJS (optionally - handling numbers in native JavaScript is scary)
