## About <a name = "about"></a>

The goal of this project is to build a Calculator App similar to the design above.
Technologies & tools will be proposed down below but feel free to use different ones if you're more familiar with them. Have fun along the way. ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜‹

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

```
- React
- class-based components
- state.
CSS styles with grid and flexbox
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo.

## Project Requirements

- The application looks similar to the design and is available for users through a link.

- AC stands for "All Clear", it should clear previous operations, incoming operations as well as the output value and bring back Calculator to the initial state.

- C stands for "Clear", it should only delete the last entry.

- Users should be able to input numbers and execute all the available operations (calculate percentage value, divide, multiply, subtract and add).

- Users should be able to get the correct result by pressing the "=" operator and add a decimal by pressing "." (maximum one decimal in the number should be present).

- Watch out for other gotchas, e.g. multiple operations (always execute "number operation number", don't evaluate more than a single pair of numbers), round long decimals, don't allow "=" on empty input, don't let to divide by 0. You'll probably find more gotchas while coding ðŸ™ˆ.

## Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

Add notes about how to use the system.
